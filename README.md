# Storing-Very-Large-Numbers-as-Prime-Factors
This is one of my most impressive Java projects. Not only does this project impliment and manage a linked list it also does advanced math with the data structure. Using the prime factors of a very large number and their muliplicity this program can store very large numbers and do math operations with them. Each node in the linked list is comprised of a prime factor and its multiplicity. The linked lists can be combined to get a new larger number, multiplied, Euclidean, greatest common denomenator and many more.
runs in Eclipse IDE
